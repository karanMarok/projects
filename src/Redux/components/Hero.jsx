It is the preeminent spiritual site of Sikhism. It is one of the holiest sites in Sikhism. The man-made pool on the site of the temple was completed by the fourth Sikh Guru, Guru Ram Das, in 1577. In 1604, Guru Arjan Dev, the fifth Sikh Guru, placed a copy of the Adi Granth in Harmandir Sahib and is the prominent figure in the development of gurudwara who built it in the 16th century</p>
